1. **Question (Multiple Choice)**: What is the primary purpose of the Choreo Marketplace?
   - A) To manage user permissions and roles in organizations
   - B) To facilitate the reuse and sharing of services deployed in Choreo
   - C) To provide deployment automation for different environments
   - D) To create and manage Kubernetes clusters

   **Answer**: B) To facilitate the reuse and sharing of services deployed in Choreo

2. **Question (True/False)**: The Choreo Marketplace allows users to filter services based on their network visibility level, which can include "Public", "Organization", and "Project".

   **Answer**: True

3. **Question (Short Answer)**: Explain the significance of semantic versioning in the Choreo Marketplace and give an example based on the description.

   **Answer**: Semantic versioning is significant in the Choreo Marketplace as it allows services to be easily identified by their major version. This ensures compatibility and facilitates automatic routing of traffic to the latest stable version of a service. For example, if a service has versions v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2, the marketplace would represent it as v1, indicating that v1.2 is the latest release in that major version.

4. **Question (Application)**: If a user searches for a service in the Choreo Marketplace using the search functionality, which of the following attributes can they search for? List at least three attributes.

   **Answer**: The user can search for the following attributes: 
   - Name (the service name)
   - Label (the service labels)
   - Content (the service content, including overview, summary, and documentation) 
   Additionally, they can search across all of these attributes using the "All" option. 

5. **Question (Higher Order Thinking)**: How would the functionality of the Choreo Marketplace improve the development process for a team working on a microservices architecture? Provide specific advantages.

   **Answer**: The Choreo Marketplace improves the development process for a team working on a microservices architecture by providing a centralized repository for discovering, sharing, and reusing services. This facilitates collaboration among developers, reduces duplication of effort, and accelerates development time since teams can easily leverage existing services instead of building from scratch. The search and filtering capabilities increase efficiency in finding relevant services, while the versioning allows teams to ensure they are using the most compatible service versions, ultimately enhancing service reliability and reducing integration issues.
