Here are 30 questions and answers based on the provided concepts:

1.  **Question:** What is the main purpose of the Marketplace feature?
    **Answer:** The main purpose is to promote and facilitate reusing and sharing services deployed within the platform.

2.  **Question:** When browsing the Marketplace, what are the two types of services you can filter by based on their deployment location?
    **Answer:** You can filter by "Internal" services (deployed within the platform) and "Third-party" services (running externally but added to the Marketplace).

3.  **Question:** What search attributes are available in the Marketplace to help you find services?
    **Answer:** You can search by Name, Label, Content (overview, summary, documentation), or All of these criteria.

4.  **Question:** When you explore a specific service in the Marketplace, what are the four tabs that provide detailed information about it?
    **Answer:** The four tabs are Overview, API definition, How to use, and Related documents.

5.  **Question:** When does a service deployed within the platform automatically appear in the Marketplace?
    **Answer:** Services automatically get added to the Marketplace upon deployment to the initial environment.

6.  **Question:** If a service has multiple versions like v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, and v2.0 deployed, how are its versions displayed in the Marketplace?
    **Answer:** The Marketplace displays service versions in their major version format, representing the latest version within that major version. So, for the example, it would show v1 (representing v1.2) and v2 (representing v2.0).

7.  **Question:** Explain the concept of "semantic-version-based intelligent routing" in the Marketplace when one service uses another as a dependency.
    **Answer:** When a component connects to a service dependency from the Marketplace using a specific major version (e.g., v1), traffic is automatically routed to the latest minor/patch version available within that major version (e.g., v1.3 if v1.2 was the previous latest). This happens automatically without manual updates within that major version.

8.  **Question:** What happens to a service's details like definition, visibility, and description in the Marketplace when the component is redeployed to any environment?
    **Answer:** During redeployment, the platform automatically updates these details for the service entry in the Marketplace.

9.  **Question:** What is the core strategy the platform uses for deploying applications across multiple environments efficiently?
    **Answer:** The platform adopts a "build once, deploy many" strategy, where an application is built only once (per commit or manual selection) and then promoted to subsequent environments.

10. **Question:** How does the platform handle environment-specific configurations and secrets (like database credentials) to keep them separate from the source code?
    **Answer:** Configurations and secrets are maintained at the environment level and dynamically injected into components at runtime. They are encrypted at rest and in transit.

11. **Question:** What happens during the build pipeline for a typical component?
    **Answer:** The build pipeline generally builds a container image, runs security/vulnerability scans (if applicable), pushes the image to a container registry, and updates service endpoints/API specifications (if applicable).

12. **Question:** If I trigger multiple builds from the exact same Git commit, will they produce different Docker images? What happens to the older images?
    **Answer:** Multiple builds from the same Git commit will generate Docker images with the same behavior (repeatable builds). However, the platform preserves only the most recent version of the Docker image created from that specific code version.

13. **Question:** What are the two primary ways a user can trigger a build for a component?
    **Answer:** Users can trigger a build manually by clicking "Build Latest" (with an option to select a specific commit) or enable "Auto Build on Commit" for automatic triggers.

14. **Question:** What is the difference between manually deploying a component and automatically deploying it on build?
    **Answer:** Manually deploying requires a user action on the Deploy page. Automatically deploying on build initiates deployment right after an automatic build completes. The latter requires "Auto Build on Commit" to be enabled.

15. **Question:** What is an "immutable deployment" in the context of configurations?
    **Answer:** Once a component is deployed with configurations, those configurations become immutable for that specific deployment instance. Any subsequent change to the configurations results in a new deployment being created.

16. **Question:** How do you move a built component from a lower environment (like development) to a higher environment (like production)?
    **Answer:** You promote the component manually across environments from the Deploy page.

17. **Question:** What type of components is the "Execute" page specifically applicable to?
    **Answer:** The Execute page is applicable only to scheduled and manual task components for tracking their executions.

18. **Question:** How does the platform ensure "zero-downtime deployments"?
    **Answer:** The platform performs rolling updates. A new build undergoes a health check before traffic is switched to it from the currently running build.

19. **Question:** What is a "Component" in this platform, and how does it relate to cloud-native applications and Kubernetes?
    **Answer:** A component is a single unit of work (like a microservice, API, or task) tied to a Git repository path. It's the platform's unit of deployment, mapping to a single pod in a Kubernetes cluster, allowing independent deployment, management, and scaling.

20. **Question:** What is the main purpose of "Connections"?
    **Answer:** Connections allow you to integrate the services deployed on the platform with other services on the platform or external resources.

21. **Question:** You have a database that several components in your project need to connect to. Should you create a Project Connection or a Component Connection for this database? Why?
    **Answer:** You should create a Project Connection. Project Connections can be used by any component within the project, making it suitable for sharing a resource like a database across multiple components.

22. **Question:** How does a component's code get the necessary details (like credentials) to connect to a service or resource defined via a Connection?
    **Answer:** When creating a Connection, you get a Connection ID and parameters. You map these parameters to environment variable names in your component's configuration. At runtime, the platform dynamically injects the actual values into these environment variables, which your service code can then read.

23. **Question:** Explain the fundamental difference between the "control plane" and the "data plane" in the platform's architecture.
    **Answer:** The control plane is the SaaS layer that handles administration (users, orgs, projects) and governs the application development lifecycle (creation, deployment, governance, observability). The data plane is the environment where user applications are deployed and run, and where all application runtime traffic resides.

24. **Question:** What is the main advantage of using a "private data plane" compared to a "cloud data plane"?
    **Answer:** A private data plane provides dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, offering an added layer of privacy and control, whereas a cloud data plane uses a multi-tenanted infrastructure.

25. **Question:** According to the private data plane observability architecture, where are logs and observability data primarily stored, and why is this approach taken?
    **Answer:** Logs and observability data are stored within the data plane itself. This approach is taken to enhance data privacy and compliance, simplify access, and reduce potential data exposure points by keeping data at the source.

26. **Question:** How does the platform ensure security for incoming traffic in a private data plane?
    **Answer:** All incoming traffic is protected by a firewall and must undergo authentication and authorization via the API Gateway.

27. **Question:** What is the primary role of "Deployment Tracks"?
    **Answer:** Deployment Tracks are structured pathways that act like advanced CI/CD pipelines to simplify software component deployment and provide an organized approach for API versioning.

28. **Question:** What are the two main ways Deployment Tracks facilitate streamlined deployments?
    **Answer:** Deployment Tracks can be used for full CI/CD integration (linked to a Git branch, triggering auto-deploy on PR merge) or as a CD-Only pipeline (linked to a container registry repository to deploy prebuilt images).

29. **Question:** What is an "Endpoint" and how does it relate to APIs and API management within a component?
    **Answer:** An Endpoint is a network-exposed function within a component. Each endpoint exposed is considered a single API, and the platform allows for API management (like lifecycle and security) to be configured individually per endpoint.

30. **Question:** Describe the high-level resource hierarchy and relationships between Organizations, Data Planes, Projects, and Environments.
    **Answer:** An Organization is the top-level logical grouping. Data Planes are connected to the Organization and available to all its Projects. A Project is a logical group of components. Environments are provisioned per Project and linked to the Data Plane(s) connected to the Organization. Components belong to a Project and are deployed into specific Environments. Multiple Kubernetes clusters can be associated with an Environment.
