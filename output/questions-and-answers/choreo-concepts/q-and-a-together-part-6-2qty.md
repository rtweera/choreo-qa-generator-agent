Here are two questions and answers about the concepts described:

1.  **Question:** I'm looking for a specific service that another team in my organization has deployed, but there are many services listed. How can I efficiently find the service I need, and what kind of information can I expect to see about it once I find it?

    **Answer:** To efficiently find a deployed service within your organization, you can use the search bar and filter options available in the service listing area. You can search by the service's name, labels associated with it, or content within its overview, summary, or documentation. Additionally, you can use filters on the left-hand side to narrow down results by service type (Internal or Third-party) or network visibility (Public, Organization, or Project). Once you find the service and click on its card, you will see a detailed view. This view includes the service name, summary, version, and labels. It also has tabs providing more information: an Overview (if provided by the developer), the API definition (extracted from the source configuration), instructions on "How to use" the service (including creating connections), and any "Related documents" that were added.

2.  **Question:** My team is working on a service component and needs a reliable way to deploy it across different environments (like development and production) while managing updates and ensuring minimal disruption. Can you explain how the platform's CI/CD capabilities and Deployment Tracks help achieve this, especially regarding service versioning?

    **Answer:** The platform provides a robust CI/CD pipeline centered around a "build once, deploy many" strategy. This means your component's code is built into a container image only once for a given commit. This identical image is then promoted across different environments (like development, staging, production) within your project. This ensures consistency across environments. Deployment Tracks act as structured pathways linked to specific branches (or container registries in CD-only scenarios), visualizing and managing these deployments and promotions across environments. For service components, Deployment Tracks are also crucial for API versioning. They allow you to associate a specific major.minor version (e.g., v1.2) with a track. The platform follows semantic versioning principles. When you deploy a new minor version (e.g., v1.3) within the same major track (v1), the service in the Marketplace automatically updates to represent the latest version (v1.3). Critically, if another component is consuming your service using a connection to the v1 major version, the platform's intelligent routing automatically directs the consumer's traffic to this latest minor version (v1.3) without requiring manual updates in the consuming component, ensuring seamless updates within a major version range and minimizing disruption. The platform also performs zero-downtime rolling updates during deployments and promotions, switching traffic only after health checks pass for the new version.
