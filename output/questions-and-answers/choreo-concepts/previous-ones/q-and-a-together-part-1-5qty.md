Here are 5 questions and answers about the concepts described:

1.  **Question:** What is the main purpose of the Choreo Marketplace, and how does using "Connections" help developers utilize services discovered in the Marketplace?

    **Answer:** The main purpose of the Marketplace is to promote and facilitate reusing and sharing services deployed within your organization. It allows developers to easily discover, browse, and search for available services. Using "Connections" is how developers integrate services found in the Marketplace (or external resources) into their own components. When a connection is created to a service, Choreo provides a Connection ID and parameters. The developer configures their component to use this ID and maps 
parameters to environment variables. At runtime, Choreo injects the correct values into these environment variables, allowing the component to programmatically connect to the consumed service in a loosely coupled manner.

2.  **Question:** Explain Choreo's "build once, deploy many" strategy for CI/CD. How are environment-specific configurations handled to support this?

    **Answer:** Choreo's "build once, deploy many" strategy means that a component's application image is built only once (per commit or selected commit). This same built image is then promoted and deployed to subsequent environments (like development, staging, production). This ensures consistency across environments. Environment-specific configurations and secrets (like database credentials or API keys) are maintained separately at the environment level, not in the source code. Choreo injects these configurations into the component at runtime for each specific environment. This separation allows the same container image to run correctly in different environments with varying settings, supporting the "deploy many" part of the strategy.

3.  **Question:** Describe the relationship between an Organization, a Project, and the Environments within Choreo based on the provided hierarchy. How do these relate to Components?

    **Answer:** An Organization is the top-level logical grouping of users and resources. Data planes (where applications run) are connected to the Organization and are available to all projects within it. A Project is a logical group of related Components, typically representing a single cloud-native application, and is represented as a "cell". Environments (like development or production) are provisioned per Project. Components belong to a Project. When a Component is deployed, it is deployed as a container into a specific Environment within its Project. Components can then be promoted across other Environments available to that Project. The resource hierarchy flows from Organization down through Data Planes, Projects, and Environments to Components.

4.  **Question:** True or False: In a Choreo Private Data Plane, logs and observability data are primarily sent to the Choreo control plane for storage and analysis to ensure compliance. Justify your answer based on the text.

    **Answer:** False. The documentation explicitly states that the private data plane observability architecture is centered around a strong commitment to data privacy and compliance by making a strategic decision to *retain logs and observability data within the data planes itself*. The Choreo Console in the user's browser directly interacts with APIs in the data plane to fetch this data, minimizing data transfer points and keeping the data in its original environment.

5.  **Question:** You have a service component `ProductAPI` with versions `v1.0`, `v1.1`, and `v2.0` deployed. Another component, `WebApp`, uses a Connection to `ProductAPI` version `v1`.
    a) How will `ProductAPI` be displayed in the Choreo Marketplace regarding versioning?
    b) If `ProductAPI` version `v1.2` is deployed (a new minor version), what happens to the Marketplace display for the v1 major version?
    c) After `v1.2` is deployed, where will the `WebApp` component's traffic automatically route when calling `ProductAPI` v1?

    **Answer:**
    a) The Choreo Marketplace displays service versions in their major version format, representing the latest version within that major version. So, `ProductAPI` would be displayed as `v1` (representing `v1.1` or `v1.2` if deployed) and `v2` (representing `v2.0`).
    b) When `v1.2` is deployed, the corresponding service entry for `v1` in the Marketplace will automatically update to reflect `v1.2` as the latest version within the `v1` major range.
    c) Due to semantic-version-based intelligent routing, when `ProductAPI` version `v1.2` is deployed, the `WebApp` component's traffic (which is connected to `ProductAPI` v1) will automatically route to the latest version within the v1 range, which is now `v1.2`.
