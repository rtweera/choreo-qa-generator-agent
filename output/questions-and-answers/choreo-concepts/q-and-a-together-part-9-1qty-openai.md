1. **Question:** Describe the significance of service versioning within the Choreo Marketplace and explain how it follows semantic versioning principles. 

   **Answer:** Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace is vital as it allows users to identify and utilize the latest stable release of a service without manual intervention. It adheres to semantic versioning principles by displaying only the major version of a service (e.g., `v1`, `v2`), while maintaining access to the latest iterations within that major version. For instance, if a service has versions `v1.0`, `v1.1`, and `v2.0`, the Marketplace will show `v1` representing `v1.1` and `v2` representing `v2.0`. This automates traffic routing to the most current version in the same major version range as dependencies evolve, ensuring compatibility and stability without requiring consumers to update their connections frequently.
